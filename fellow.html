      </div>
      <h4 id="vaccine-dashboard" style="text-align:left; color:#4d4d4d">What is the PathCheck DICE Fellow initiative?</h3>
        <p class="blue-underline"> The PathCheck CH Fellow initiative is a program started by the PathCheck Foundation, a 501(c) non-profit organization spun out of MIT. The Fellow program intends to support doctoral students from selected countries to carry out impactful research on computational health, AI for public health, Computational Privacy in Health, and much more! The Fellowship supports the selected fellows by providing a quarterly grant to support DICE research initiatives for 1 year, provided they continue to maintain expectations set by the foundation. Apart from the financial support, the fellows get access to multiple data sources, a world-class research community with international Professors, Post-Docs, and other graduate students from institutions like MIT, CMU, Harvard, Mayo Clinic, University of Montreal, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and many more!</a></p>
        <h4 id="vaccine-dashboard" style="text-align:left; color:#4d4d4d">Who is eligible?</h3>
            <p class="blue-underline"> All doctoral students working on computational health, bioinformatics, etc with a focus on building scholarship in the direction of public health using data, machine learning, or more are invited to apply! In addition, we highly encourage applications from groups historically underrepresented in the computational health field. A faculty advisor can nominate a maximum of 2 students to ensure diversity in the application.  </p>
        <h4 id="vaccine-dashboard" style="text-align:left; color:#4d4d4d">What are the benefits of being a PathCheck CH Fellow?</h3>
                <p class="blue-underline"> <ol> <li>Financial support (by quarter) to support the impactful work (given the fellow maintains the expectations set by the foundation in terms of research and contributions)</li>
                <li>Access to an amazing network of AI and digital health experts and to the large user base on our Slack and our digital health open source initiatives!  </li>
                <li>Access to private data sources - For instance, we recently signed a Data User Agreement (DUA) with Facebook, Carnegie-Mellon University (CMU), and the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD CP) to get access to de-identified individual-level data from the COVID-19 surveys they run.</li>
                <li>Work with researchers like Sue Feldman (the University of Alabama at Birmingham), Manuel Morales (University of Montreal, Quebec), Pranav Rajpurkar (Harvard), Byran Wilder (CMU), Lav Varshney (UIUC), Tavpritesh Sethi (IIIT Delhi), Swaminathan Pathmanabhan Iyer (MD Anderson Cancer Centre), Thomas C. Kingsley (Mayo Clinic), Ramesh Raskar (MIT Media Lab), and more!</li>

        <p class="blue-underline">In collaboration with data scientists and medical researchers from Pennsylvania State University, Mayo Clinic and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, we have been working on analyzing reports on adverse events following vaccination. The Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) is a post-licensure monitoring system that has been established to ensure the safety of vaccines. The VAERS collects and analyzes reports of adverse events that happen after vaccination. As part of our commitment to provide systems support for vaccine safety, we are conducting various data analytics studies on adverse events reported to the VAERS from December 15, 2020. The output of this ongoing research takes the form of a dashboard and research papers that improve our understanding of adverse events and leverage the generated insights to contribute to vaccine awareness efforts. A first paper has been submitted to JAMA.  <br> <br> View the preprint: <a href="#">[INSERT TITLE]</a></p>
    <h4 id="deep-abm"  style="text-align:left; color:#4d4d4d">Deep Agent Based Modeling (DeepABM)</h3>
        <p class="blue-underline">The current sanitary crisis has come at great cost to our economies. Sacrifices have already been made in order to curb the spread and safe lives. As hard choices still remain ahead of us, it is paramount to have a comprehensive understanding of how public health interventions, economic incentives and strategic lockdowns impact can be optimized to allow for economic recovery. The dynamic of these interactions, taking place while the epidemiological dynamics of the virus spread run in the background, is poorly understood. In macroeconomics, agent-based models (ABM) have been successfully used to understand these types of interactions among agents and institutions. Recent studies incorporate the COVID-19 spread into economic studies with the goal of modelling these interactions and eventually serve as gym environments for intervention optimization analysis. One bottle-neck of such models is the computational constraints. Realistic models with a sizable number of agents and interactions are unrealistic from the computational standpoint. Together with a group from MIT, we have been working on a framework called deepABM that uses the notion of convolution in a graph neural network architecture to model interactions between agents. By construction, these interactions can be parallelized and existing frameworks like Pytorch Geometric can be leveraged to efficiently implement realistic ABM models. This project is currently exploring such one implementation.   <br> <br> View the preprint: <a href="#">[INSERT TITLE]</a></p> -->
